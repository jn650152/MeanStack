This is a tutorial project usng MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Pug Engine. 
This project is a simple web application, making full use of MVC.

Users can insert, update, delete and search records in Mongodb via the interation with webpages.
Also, restful APIs are implemented so users also have access to these four operations via command line or mobile appilcation.
Furthermore, this web application can validate the input and return related responses.

Syncronization can be integrated to the application to make database queries more efficient.
However,this is just a simple application so there is no need to add syncronization for it.
There are three types of syncronization, including waterfall, series and parallel.
For future more complex applications, this factor will be taken into consideration.
